# Kotlin MutableList: Subtle Differences in Remove Operations

This example showcases the subtle, yet important, distinctions between the `remove`, `removeAt`, and `removeAll` methods available for `MutableList` in Kotlin.  Misunderstanding these differences can lead to unexpected behavior in your code.

The `bug.kt` file demonstrates the use of each method and their respective outputs. The `bugSolution.kt` file (although not strictly needed for a simple demonstration) may include additional comments for clarity or demonstrate alternative safer approaches.
